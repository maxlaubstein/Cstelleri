This directory contains scripts used to classify the hybrid individuals found within the SE Idaho - Utah contact zone between ssp. annectens and ssp. macrolopha.
LD pruned dataset of all 310 individuals subsetted to just the contact zone samples, pure macrolopha, and pure annectens samples.
This results in vcf of 498368 LD pruned SNPs in file "pops80-102_LD_Pruned.vcf".  
This vcf was then further filtered to only include SNPs fixed between parental annectens (pops 80-82) and macrolopha (89-102) samples.
The file pops80-102_LD_Pruned_fixed.recode.vcf contains these 8479 fixed SNPs.
fixedSNPs.sh includes the commands used in this process.

triangleplotting.R includes R code to generate a triangle plot of heterozygosity vs hybrid index calculated from these SNPs.
