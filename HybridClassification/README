This directory contains scripts used to classify the hybrid individuals found within the SE Idaho - Utah contact zone between ssp. annectens and ssp. macrolopha.
LD pruned dataset of all 310 individuals subsetted to just the contact zone samples, pure macrolopha, and pure annectens samples.
This results in vcf of 498368 LD pruned SNPs in file "Cyanocitta_LDPruned_NWInt_Rocky.vcf.recode.vcf".  Cyanocitta_LDPruned_NWInt_Rocky.vcf.log contains process used to create this file.
